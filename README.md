# ResumeWise_Capstone_Project-NLP-ML
This is my capstone project under the 6 month DS and AI training program by NUST Pakistan.
# Summary of the proposed project idea 
ResumeWise is a proposed web application that uses natural language processing (NLP) to extract important data from resumes and score them to suggest the best job fit. The app aims to help HR teams process recruitment more efficiently and quickly by automating the resume processing step, which takes up the most time during the recruiting process.
# Outcomes of this Project 
The proposed project idea of ResumeWise, an NLP-powered resume parser, is expected to have several positive outcomes, including:
> Improved efficiency and enhanced candidate experience,
> Resume parsing tools convert unstructured resumes into a uniform and organized database, making it easier to search and sort candidates' information,
> Automated resume parsing can handle unlimited resumes, making it ideal for large recruitment processes, and can reduce the time required to review resumes, ultimately reducing the cost of the recruitment process,
> Incorporation of deep learning algorithms for improved data extraction and smart identification of resume information for better search results,
> Resume quality scoring,
> So the primary objective of resume parsing software is to enhance and simplify the recruitment workflow. It efficiently manages the tasks of collecting, analyzing, and categorizing resumes, ensuring that the hiring process is not only efficient but also effective

Overall, the proposed project idea of ResumeWise is expected to revolutionize the recruitment process by leveraging NLP to analyze resumes and convert them into structured information, making it easier for HR teams to identify the most suitable candidates quickly and efficiently
